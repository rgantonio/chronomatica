This repository is a journal for mathematical and algorithmic experiments. Varying at different levels, from basic mathematics, to deep learning, vector-symbolic architectures, and so much more.

# :city_sunrise: Directory Structure

Each directory has a mix of Python codes, Jupyter notebooks, and mark down notes. As much as possible, each concept is properly organized.

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: `math`: has basic math principles.
- :dragon_face: `dl`: is for deep-learning content used for understanding better the state-of-the-art deep-learning AI algorithms.
- :white_flower: `vsa`: is for Vector Symbolic Architectures. A cool growing AI concept about brain-inspired algorithms.
- :recycle: `others`: contains a bunch of non-academic (or probably some) content.
